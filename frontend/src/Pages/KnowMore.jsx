        <h2>Clarification Regarding the Purpose of This Website</h2>
        <p>It has come to our attention that there may be some misunderstandings regarding the purpose and intent behind this website. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify that this website has been created purely as a test of development skills and for fun. It is not, in any way, associated with fraud, misinformation, or any unethical activities.</p>

        <h2>Purpose of the Website</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of this website is to serve as a demonstration of technical capabilities in web development. It showcases how student result data can be displayed dynamically, but it does not hold or provide any actual official results of students from Class 10, Class 12, or any other academic level. The content displayed is purely for testing and learning purposes.</p>

        <h2>Not Meant to Spread Rumors or Misinformation</h2>
        <p>We want to make it explicitly clear that this platform is not intended to spread any rumors, false information, or misleading content. Any resemblance to actual examination results or student data is purely coincidental. The website does not claim authenticity for any displayed results and should not be mistaken as an official or authorized platform for checking academic performance.</p>

        <h2>No Connection to Fraudulent Activities</h2>
        <p>This website is not involved in any fraudulent activity, including but not limited to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Falsification of student results</li>
          <li>Misrepresentation of official examination data</li>
          <li>Misleading individuals for financial or personal gain</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect and baseless. Our intention is solely to explore web development techniques and improve programming skills. </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Users of this website are encouraged to treat all displayed data as fictional and for demonstration purposes only. Official student results should always be verified through authorized government or educational institution portals.
          <br />
        We appreciate your understanding and support in ensuring that this website is viewed in the right contextâ€”as a learning and development experiment rather than an official or fraudulent platform.</p>
